### Steps to generate referral messages:

1. In the names.json file, add the details of the company in the following format : 
    {"companyName":{
        "Job role": [
            "firstName Sir/Mam",
            "firstName Sir/Mam",
        ]
    }}

The firstName is the first name of the person you are asking for a referral.
